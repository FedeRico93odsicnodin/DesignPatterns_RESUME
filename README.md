Do you want to learn more about Design Patterns?
This is the project made for you! You can find a presentation of the most important Design Patterns with related DEMO at the end of each presentation.
You can just have a look to the EXE in the bin part for having the DEMO (console) or decide to contribute to future steps (WPF and MVC CORE projects).
If you are interested contact me.
